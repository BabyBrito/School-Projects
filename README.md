# Projects done for classes.

Nim Game: This project is a classical represntation of the Nim game where it will be played on the console where choices will be prompted to the user. Here I implemented a player 
interface so that the user can select from 3 diffrent levels of players with the last option beieng another player itself. The point of the game is to avoid being
the last person to have to remove a nim marble from the pile. If you know the trick you will never lose as long as you have the first turn.

3D shpes: This projectshowcases my use of both concrete and abstrac classes as well as the use of the comparator interface and comparable by creating a compareTo method.
Here we create Point3D class used to represent the center point in a 3D object to get diffrent measurements for the object such as volume, surface area, distance from the
point origin to the center of the 3D object.

Polynomial: This project showcases my use of the Linked List ADT where we create a term class in a polynomial such as 3x^2 where we have a coefficient 3 and the exponent if the variable 2. We then create a polynomial class that uses a linked list to add an array of polynomials where we can then add a term to the polynomial, add or multiply all the polynomials, and finally collect like terms.
